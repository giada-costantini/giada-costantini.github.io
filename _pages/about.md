Hi! I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center on Forced Displacement](https://www.bu.edu/cfd/) at Boston University. I love to spend my time thinking, researching, writing, and --- just as importantly --- learning from others. I’m an interdisciplinary researcher who believes strongly in the power of knowledge co-production, and my work is guided by a commitment to advancing social justice. 
I hold a PhD in Sociology of Education from the University of Birmingham, completed under the supervision of Professor Dina Kiwan and Dr. Valentina Migliarini. 

Previously, I was research and teaching associate at the University of Birmingham. Over the past five years, I have also worked as a consultant for several international organizations, including the World Bank, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE). I have also completed internships with the Education Cannot Wait --- the United Nations Global Fund for Education in Emergencies --- and with EducAid.

**NEWS**: I am currently co-editing a special section of the International Journal of Disability, Development and Education (IJDDE) on the topic of “Inclusive Education: Displacement and Disability in Southern Contexts” with Professor Elizabeth Walton (University of Nottingham). Check the call for manuscript [here]( /files/call_ijdde.pdf) and feel free to reach out should you be interested in sending an abstract!
