Hi! I’m currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Center on Forced Displacement](https://www.bu.edu/cfd/) at Boston University. I love to spend my time thinking, researching, writing, and --- just as importantly --- learning from others. I’m an interdisciplinary researcher who believes strongly in the power of knowledge co-production, and my work is guided by a commitment to advancing social justice. 
I hold a PhD in Sociology of Education from the University of Birmingham, affiliated to  the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) – Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRRC), funded by the Network Plus [Disability Under Siege Programme](https://disabilityundersiege.org/), and supervised by Professor Dina Kiwan and Dr. Valentina Migliarini. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to study in diverse international contexts, including the University of Naples L’Orientale and IULM University in Italy, as well as the University of Sussex in the UK.

Over the past five years, I have worked as a consultant for several international organizations, including the World Bank, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO), and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE). I have also completed internships with the Education Cannot Wait—the United Nations Global Fund for Education in Emergencies—and with EducAid. Earlier in my career, I worked as an Italian language teacher in Egypt at Ahlan Egypt Alexandria.

*NEWS*: I am currently co-editing a special section of the International Journal of Disability, Development and Education (IJDDE) on the topic of “Inclusive Education: Displacement and Disability in Southern Contexts” with Professor Elizabeth Walton (University of Nottingham). Check the call for manuscript [Here]( /files/call_ijdde.pdf) and feel free to reach out should you be interested in sending an abstract!
